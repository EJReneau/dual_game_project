# dual_game_project
A program that allows the user to choose one of two games to play and then play the game of their choice in a GUI interface. The images for the files are inluded in the DECK and DICE folders. This is both one of the biggest and one of my favorite things I have made with Python so far, and as such I wanted to share it here! It was also the first project I did with GUI programming. Also, the dual_game_demo.mp4 is a walkthrough of me demonstrating the program on my computer, so I encourage you to please watch it to see how the program itself runs since I hard-coded the image file paths if you do not want to change those paths yourself. Feedback is always appreciated and I hope you enjoy the project as much as I do!
